# Login
A simple program that lets you register a user and do a login
This was one of my earlier Android Projects, where I started to learn about views
and how to navigate between views. The program checks inputs from the edittext fields
and if the inputs match an existing user you will be taken to the MembersActivity View. 
Otherwise you will get an error message. The app is built after a MVC structure. The app dosn't save data between sesions.
